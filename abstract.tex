In the last two years the software landscape on Rubin Observatory construction project  has changed dramatically. We are transitioning from siloed software teams to a  more integrated approach. LSST has Labview, C++, Python and Java components which use a variety of build systems and have uneven test harnesses. As we approach deployment on the mountain we would like to converge on build and versioning for all systems. In addition we intend to use  a Foreman, Puppet and Kubernetes based deployment system.   In this talk we will outline the vision for software build and deployment across all Rubin Observatory subsystems and where we currently are with it.
As the Commissioning Execution Plan (LSE-390) says, "The project team shall
deliver all reports documenting the as-built hardware and software including:
drawings, source code, modifications, compliance exceptions, and recommendations
for improvement." As a first step towards the delivery of documents that will describe the system at the
end of construction, we are assembling teams for producing of the order 40 papers
that eventually will be submitted to relevant professional journals. The immediate goal is to accomplish
all the writing that can be done without data analysis before the data
taking begins, and the team becomes much more busy and stressed.

This document provides the template for these papers.
